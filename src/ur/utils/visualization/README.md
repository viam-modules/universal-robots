### Instructions

Run `make create-config`. This will create a `config.json` file which the user will need to update with two pieces of information, the part-id of the machine as well as the unix timestamp of the data they wish to graph.
Please note, if you are using an executable you will need to change `viam_universal-robots` to `universal-robots-executable`

Now we are ready to create graphs! To do so just run `make graphs`
